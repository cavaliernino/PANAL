Space Apps Challenge COVID-19. Team PANAL. 05/30/2020.

The COVID-19 pandemic and it's lack of valid information makes the world a place full with uncertainty. Even science is
looking for answers to tackle this pandemic, which with its fast spreading is challenging all the world with a little 
known scenery.

Right now there are multiple initiatives to research a vaccine that solves this pandemic and erradicates this threats.
However, in the meantime (time that probably spans many months or even years) we need to avoid spreading of the disease 
by more 'traditional' means. Past tells us that social distancing is the best way to avoid spreading of this virus, so 
we must try to keep safe at home. 

There's a lot of people that can work safe from their homes, but a big percentage of the world's population hasn't been 
able to keep at home, because of their works are critical to the economy, environment, or simply their employers didn't 
care. There is where assistance is needed to have information of the environment to try to keep safe when not at home. 

PANAL is a mobile app and complete information platform that addresses this issues, collecting spreading information in 
a way that mobile users can see easily if they are in threat of infection where they are or where they need to head to. 
This app does not encourage to get out of the house by providing this information, but provides safety information to 
people who really needs or must to go out, showing to them a heat map of the disease, using the available information.

The first phase of the app uses the publicly available information, not necesarily dissagregated to show the needed 
granularity and resolution in the map, but is the way we can show how PANAL can provide the information. In this phase 
we are using local data (Chile) whose resolution is in the city level. Using population density information we cross 
this data and elaborate a heat map that shows the county level threat to infection. The second phase uses the best 
available information to enhance the help provided.

The last intended escalation of this solution must be using governments resources around the world, to make medics that 
provides positive test results to COVID-19, input this info to PANAL platform and thus, provide the best possible input 
to the PANAL system. In this way, PANAL can link the medic input to the patient's phone, being able to calculate the risk of infection with the best granularity, without any data related to the infected individual, keeping inbound of any risk to people privacity. PANAL is completely an Open Source project, to be able to ensure this. The world's population need to be assured that the information is not used en any other means that to help to stop this COVID-19 and any pandemic with rapid spreading abilities. The medical software needs to be trusted to be effective, and PANAL is designed with this base principle as a solid foundation.
